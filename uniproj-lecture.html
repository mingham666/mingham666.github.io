    <h1>Project Based Learning - Doncaster Security Lecture</h1>
    <p>Out of all the assignments I've done at university, this is the one I was dreading the most when it was announced exactly what we had to do. The brief said to create an event day doing something IT related, it could be anywhere and on almost anything, so the scope of it was huge. To give you an idea, some people went to primary schools to talk about safety online, another group did something called "Tech for Troops" where they got those in the forces up to speed with certain technologies. My group however, chose to give a computer security lecture at Doncaster College.</p>

<h1>What I Did</h1>
    <p>We had such a silly amount of prep to do for this, honestly. Our group was randomly selected, so you had to work around another courses timetabling constraints, same as in the real world I suppose, add in tons of communication difficulties and you get the idea. My role was to talk about how great Sheffield Hallam was to study at (If you're reading this from SHU - give me free stuff for the glowing endorsement!), as well as what my course was all about. I took pictures of the labs, designed the logo we used on the slides, and wrote up most of the slide content. On the day, I was first up to speak to a packed lecture theatre about computer security, university life, and computer networks. We had some fun, practical examples of public and private key exchange, and some "Socrative" tests for the audience to do on their phones in the intermissions.</p>

<h1>The Results</h1>
    <p>After it was all done, I was actually surprised at how well we did, I still managed to get a first in the module despite the huge set backs we had, which were: One of our group members quit right before the lecture, we couldn't get any nifty freebies to take along that the university were offering, and the biggest of all - the media students at Doncaster College LOST our video we had to use as PROOF we actually did the damned thing! One of our group had to go back down and get video testimonies to say that we did, in fact, do the lecture we said we did. Now that the dust has settled on all of that, I'd consider doing it again, I wouldn't be totally against the idea of being a teacher either. We shall see what the future holds.</p>
