    <h1>Avelino Media</h1>
    <p>Avelino was an interesting one, some friends of a friend had an idea that they wanted to flesh out with the use of a website to promote their ideas and services. Their idea was a service that works to increase internet traffic/presence for small and local businesses. It sounded interesting, so I was more than happy to flesh out a website that they may refer potential customers to. Avelino featured a parallax scrolling effect for the slides on desktop broswers, and a clean, no-nonsense presentation throughout.</p>

<h1>What I Did</h1>
    <p>This site included a lot of custom images being created. I designed and created the logo myself, and all of the background images, such as the town silhouette and the global connections image. I picked out colours that would imitate the sun setting over the town as the page scrolled, and generally went for dark blues, purples and blacks. The site scales well for mobile devices as to be expected, and doesnâ€™t sacrifice any usability when on such devices aside from some small niggles with the parallax effect, depending of the phone and/or browser. CSS and HTML was done mostly from scratch, and there was plans for a contact form and an area for the admin to login to view messages in the very near future. Unfortunately for them, they we're unable to get their idea passed the initial stages, which meant further work on the site was not required on my end.</p>

<h1>Why I Did It</h1>
    <p>This was the first time someone had actually wanted me to build something like this for them, I usually just mucked about with personal projects, because despite enjoying the odd bit of web development, I'm certainly no expert on it. The idea they had though was interesting to me, and I was happy to give it a go, even if the business didn't work out for them in the end.</p>


<h1>Who I Did It For</h1>
    <p>I did this project, as mentioned previously, for two friends who I was acquainted with through another long time mate of mine. While this particular idea didn't work out for them, I have no doubt they will find something that does.</p>
