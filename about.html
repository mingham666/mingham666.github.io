    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello! thanks for visiting my portfolio site, I hope I got all the media queries correct so it looks as good on your device as it does mine. My name is Max Ingham and I'm currently a student at Sheffield Hallam University. While this is a rather cliche personal statement line, I do like to think of myself as rather pragmatic in my problem solving, as well as a keen attention to detail. As you can see from my grades below, I am currently on track to recieve at least a 2:1 or perhaps even a first class degree in Computer Networks. I've found that as the years go on, I enjoy imparting the things I've learned unto other people, this is probably one of the reasons I chose to do some cheap (and often free) tech support type work for my local area of Pudsey in my gap year. Recently, I've found I enjoy making websites, and have managed to drum up a bit of business because of that. If you view the sites I have created, you will see proof of my earlier statements, expecially about my attention to detail. I've enjoyed my time at University, but what I'm really looking forward to is graduating so I may further build upon the knowledge I've gained at university and apply it at the workplace (again, sorry the cliche line, but it's true!). I'd love for you to contact me should you have any questions, please also let me know if you find any strange bugs on this site, I'm always improving!</p>
    <h1>Contact</h1>
    <p>You can currently reach me at my student email address, which is - Max.Ingham@student.shu.ac.uk</p>

<h1>Gap Year Experience</h1>
    <p>G-Research: Worked from September 2016 - November 2016 for G-Research in London. Regrettably Had to leave prematurely due to health and other issues, but the technologies I worked with in my time there were: PCoIP, Windows Server, Powershell Scripting, and some various Server Hardware.</p>
    <p>Freelance: For the rest of the year I provided cheap technical support to my local community, where word of mouth got me a decent amount of work to keep busy. Later on in the year, I created multiple websites for individuals and small businesses. You may view some of these site projects I did on the projects page.</p>
