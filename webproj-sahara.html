    <h1>Sahara Dashboard</h1>
    <p>I was the one to move into our shared flat first in the final year of university. During this time, I got restless after finishing up any revision I thought I may need for the upcoming semester, so I put my time to better use than just dossing about an empty flat. Knowing that there would be an obscene amount of IT gear in this flat when my mates moved in, I decided to create a makeshift dashboard system to keep track of all the devices on the network and save any useful information pertaining to them. With this in mind, Sahara (Server and Host Abridged Registration Archive) was born, and yes, I really did phone it in with that acronym.</p>

<h1>What I Did</h1>
    <p>This was very different to anything else I'd done, and as a result, had to do much troubleshooting to get things like the ping function to work as well as I wanted it to. I have no doubt that a professional would be disgusted at the code I fudged to get this working, but I was extremely happy with this upon completion as it did everything I set out for it to do and was great fun. I could never figure out a secure way of storing passwords for retrieval on this site though. I was able to reuse a bunch of the code from my music blog, and then add to it to create the desired functionality. CSS was done from scratch and is fairly simple, as well as designing the logo. I ran the WAN pinger via PHP CLI on the server it ran on.</p>

<h1>Why I Did It</h1>
    <p>We had a seriously silly amount of IT gear at our flat when we were all properly moved in, off the top of my head we had: 2 Dell R710 Servers, a HP Microserver, a very old HP proliant server, a Raspberry Pi, network tap, Ubiquity gigabit switch and wireless access point, 3 laptops, 2 desktop PCs, 3 chromecasts, 1 google home, a UPS, and enough cabling to run up the street and back. For this reason, I created this dashboard to keep track of everything, as well as the services we had running.</p>


<h1>Who I Did It For</h1>
    <p>I did this for myself and the two friends I was living with in the final year, we perhaps didn't get as much use out of it as I had anticipated, but it still came in super handy at times and I'm glad I made it.</p>
