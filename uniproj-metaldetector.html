    <h1>Web Applications Development - Events Site</h1>
    <p>This is what made me want to create a few sites here and there in my spare time, this was the catalyst for my hundreds of hours spent slaving over sublime text until the early hours of the morning. This quickly became my favourite module in the second year, and this was the first site I ever made. I never considered myself a programmer/coder of any sort, but upon taking this module I became a lot softer towards the idea of doing this as a potential career, despite my lack of proper experience, and my course not focussing on anything like this. I got a first on this assignment mostly due to how my tutor really liked how I'd really made it my own and done something I was interested in instead of something that would check the boxes on the grading sheet. Metal Detector eventually became <a href="webproj-powerfoundry.html">Folkvangr</a>.</p>

<h1>What I Did</h1>
    <p>Before I started the code, I created an interactive flash mockup (am I the only guy who still uses flash?) so I knew exactly what I wanted to do before I got stuck in properly. I designed and created the logo (of course), and created the appropriate site graphics, such as the grey construction tape banner. I'm still low key proud of the name too, too bad the domain name was taken when I started making what would become Power Foundry (later rebranded to Folkvangr). Obviously, since this was a university project, I started from absolute zero, not even a boiler plate. One of the first things I did was create the database structure, and then built upon that structure. The site featured a live search system, an image slider, and a feature to check your username on the sign-up page against taken usernames in the database. I also made it so in your account overview, clicking your booked gig would take you to a Google Maps map displaying the venue location.</p>

<h1>The Results</h1>
    <p>The site came out almost exactly how I wanted it, my standards are much higher now of course, but for the time it was the best I could offer, I still think it was decently technically impressive compared to its successor site Power Foundry/Folkvangr. I also recieved some of the best feedback I've ever gotten from this module, full of great hard rock and heavy metal puns, I appreciate that Martin! On the downside, I forgot to back up the database from the university's servers before they wiped the disk to make way for the new second years' sites, so the images below are slim pickings and not wholly representative of what the site looked like (because the data is missing and the last backed up copy I have had a few broken pages), but the general feel is close enough.</p>
