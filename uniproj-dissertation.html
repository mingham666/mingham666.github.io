    <h1>Final Year Project - Internet of Things Dissertation</h1>
    <p>The final year project, the bane of any final year students life and a massive uphill battle the entire way. My initial idea was to do a language learning site that adapts and changes the site as you learn more as a sort of immersion mode. I was quickly brought back down to earth after a meeting from one of the potential supervisors telling me (indirectly) that it probably wouldn't be possible for me to do due to a number of things, such as me being on a networks course, and the fact that my coding experience is poor. (I did manage to create a basic version of the site with hacked together PHP code though, it picked words from a pool and kept track of how often you got it right/wrong and used that to determine whether you'd learnt the word or not). When that idea got shot down, I visited a supervisor on a whim about IoT security as a suggestion for a final year project, not realising that it pertained to non consumer devices like industrial sensors and GPS tracking, not smart doorbells and the like. Once I got handy with it, I was able to produce something that gained very high grades.</p>

<h1>What I Did</h1>
    <p>Initially, the idea my supervisor had was to use python to create a machine learning application that analysed LoRaWAN messages to identify weaknesses in the encryption methods used. There was a major problem with this - I have never touched Python in my life, and it was unlikely I could learn it to a good standard in the time I had as well as having to juggle four other modules with works that had ramped up massively in the final year. After agonising over it for around five months, I finally decided I wanted to shift the focus of my dissertation to denial of service attacks, due to some information I was able to uncover by playing around with the equipment that had been loaned to me. With only a month left and the only work I had on my dissertation up to that point being a literature survey and half a methodology, I had to really crack on. Due to the type of data that is left unencrypted in LoRaWAN packets, I was able to devise a makeshift method of guessing when the next message of a target was due to arrive, and then block that message due to LoRaWAN gateways only being half duplex. This consisted of collecting massive amounts of data and crunching some numbers in Excel.</p>

<h1>The Results</h1>
    <p>The results were that it was possible, at a basic level at the very least, to time the arrival of target messages so that an attacker may transmit data at the same time in order to take advantage of the half duplex nature of the gateways. The calculator I created allowed me to plug in some data that would then generate a list of predicted message arrival times, as well as the times that the attacker should send their message. I also was able to implement a basic method of guarding against an attack like this. Overall I recieved 81% for my dissertation, and to date it is the most intense piece of work I have ever had to do.</p>
