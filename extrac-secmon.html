    <h1>Security Monitor</h1>
    <p>I stumbled on this by total accident, it was a Reddit post about someone who mentioned a similar project to this casually in their post, and it piqued my interest in a big way. Basically, you can carefully hack the polarising layers away on an LCD monitor and then fashion some nifty glasses out of the filter to ensure that only the person wearing the glasses can see what's on the monitor. As soon as one of my monitors outlived its usefullness, I took the boxcutter to it and got to work.</p>

<h1>What I Did</h1>
    <p>It felt horrible slashing the screen with a blade, but I was determined to get this to work. What I did was: remove the bezel of the monitor to better expose the LCD panel, and then ran the blade all around the edge of the unit. It took ages before I actually managed get hold of a bit of the filter and pull, it kept flaking off in tiny bits, so I thought I'd knackered it. Turns out, the best way I found to slash it if you're having problems was to hold the blade as horizontal to the screen as possible and slice it in an arc, I was able to get a solid grip on the filter then. Under the filter is actually some sort of thin layer that can look like you've scratched the screen to hell after removing the filter, but this can be safely removed with some alcohol. All that was left is to find some old glasses frames and stick the filter to them, note that the filter must be the correct way round and have the anti-glare sheet removed from it (it will be blurry at a distance if the anti-glare is still present).</p>

<h1>The Results</h1>
    <p>Amazingly, it worked and I didn't get a mark on the screen at all, despite really hacking away at it. Annoyingly, I wear glasses anyway, so having glasses over glasses for me is really awkward, so i'm going to get some frames as big as sunglasses or those 3D glasses you get at the pictures to sit more comfortably on my face. The monitor displays some ghosting of an image if looked at side-on, but there's no way you would be able to make out anything like text or a video, it will just be a white screen to everyone else.</p>
