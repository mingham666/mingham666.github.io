    <h1>Learning Japanese</h1>
    <p>I wasn't going to include this, as my progress at the moment is woefully slow, that's why it's at the very bottom of the projects page. Everyone always seems to make some kind of resolution to learn a language, but never follow through with it. This has been me year in and year out, but I managed to start reading the Genki textbook at the beginning of this year (very slowly I might add, due to being busy freelancing some stuff). In three months I managed to get to a point where the university accepted me on to the Stage 2 Japanese course, meaning I'd managed to crunch through the equivalent of stage 1 (almost a year of teaching) in just three months, which I was happy with. You apparently can't start a language course at SHU as your elective module at Stage 1, that's why I had to crunch down and get to something at least loosely resembling Stage 2 level as quickly as I did.</p>

<h1>What I'm Doing</h1>
    <p>The best way for me to start all this was to slowly read the Genki 1 textbook and make notes, as well as doing all the end of chapter activities diligently. I also use Memrise for a bunch of community created courses (Nukemarine is a god amongst men). This is my current self taught course plan of action, as well as a bit of Remembering the Kanji, which I use a Memrise course for. Be wary if you visit /r/learnjapanese for advice, you can get equal parts solid, study changing advice and elitist "holier than thou" ramblings.</p>

<h1>The Current Results</h1>
    <p>Very minimal at the moment, especially since the website development I've been doing has made it so I've had gaps of months in my language study, I'm hoping the course at SHU will help a great deal, even if it is just bouncing around questions I can't find answers to on Google.</p>
