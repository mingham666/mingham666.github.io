    <h1>Bubbles Launderette</h1>
    <p>This bit of work came along immediately after I finished work on Avelino (no rest for the wicked!). There are a few Bubbles Launderettes local to me, but the store this site was made for is the Bubbles Launderette of Rawdon (the owners of which used to own all the others until they were sold off). This was my second paid job as a freelance website developer, so I took it without even thinking about it, anything to grow the old portfolio after all! I actually struggled on this one a bit, mostly due to being uncertain about which direction to take the design in, but I got there in the end.</p>

<h1>What I Did</h1>
    <p>This time, the client already had a logo. However, they didn’t have it as a digital file for me to use due to the logo being around on the storefront for so long I assume, it must of been commissioned once when the store first opened and then forgotten about. Because of that, I had to recreate the logo from scratch using an image of the storefront as a reference. This site features a grid-type layout of sorts, so I inserted the provided images and chose muted colours to display as a background for the text. The site has a very neutral feel to it due to the colour choices, and features a lot of clean lines. A full width Google Maps map is featured above the footer.</p>

<h1>Why I Did It</h1>
    <p>I knew this one would be a challenge before I took it on, that’s one of the main reasons I was so eager to jump on it. The sites I usually create fit more modern businesses, especially those that are pertaining to technology, but a launderette is a very traditional thing, so for the longest time I was unsure which direction to take it. Despite not being the most challenging in terms of problem solving and workload, it was certainly one of the harder projects I’ve done, and the one I’ve probably learned the most from, both from a technical standpoint and a customer facing one.</p>


<h1>Who I Did It For</h1>
    <p>This was requested by the owners of the Bubbles Launderette in Rawdon, since they’d never had an online presence of any kind, aside from the odd Yelp or Google review. Because of this, they were keen to have a site to which they could refer potential customers to. I was told it would help with all the people who ring up asking about machine prices, the various service costs, and otehr trvial things better suited online. Now they can just point them to this site, and everyone’s happy.</p>
