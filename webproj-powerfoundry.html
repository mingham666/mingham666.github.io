    <h1>Folkvangr Music Blog</h1>
    <p>Folkvangr (formerly branded "Power Foundry") was an idea I had after completing the “Web Applications Development” module of my Computer Networks course at SHU. The site I created for that module was “Metal Detector” which you can find <a href="uniproj-metaldetector.html">here</a>, I enjoyed the module enough to actually start having a crack at creating my own sites properly. Heavy Metal music is one of the biggest pleasures I have in life, so the idea of having my own personal space to upload news and reviews was very appealing to me after the module completion. Fortunately, a lot of the PHP code for the data retrieval and manipulation from the database that was written in the module for the Metal Detector site was of a suitable enough quality that I was able to reuse most of it for Folkvangr. The HTML, CSS and database structure had to be totally redone however.</p>

<h1>What I Did</h1>
    <p>I tried to do as much as possible myself as I always do when creating websites. With that said, I did use bootstrap for the responsive navigation bar, which I then customised heavily to suit the sites' needs. I  drew the logo myself, created a fully functional CMS to add, delete, and update blog posts, album reviews, band pages, and site authors. Apart from the bootstrap parts of the site, all of the CSS was done from scratch and the site is fully mobile responsive. As for the database, I designed it with scalability in mind should I want to incorporate more features into the site in the future, all passwords stored in the database for the author accounts have been hashed and salted.</p>

<h1>Why I Did It</h1>
    <p>I could have used Wix, Wordpress, or even Google Blogs to build a blogging/reviews site much easier (even though I wouldn’t be able to live with myself as an IT student and technology enthusiast if I hadn’t built it myself), but I wanted to have a site which was 100% mine, where I could manipulate all of the files, and do all the necessary upkeep and setup tasks required when setting up a site like this. After the university project site I did, the idea of a fully fleshed out reviews site seemed feasible to me, so I gave it a crack and this was the result.</p>


<h1>Who I Did It For</h1>
    <p>This was for me and any friends that are interested in having reviews published online, but the site was created mostly to prove I could. I plan to offer guest review spots to interested third parties should I be successful in driving traffic to the site, as well as building the content base much more. For the moment though, the reviews are done by myself when I get some spare time (which isn’t often) and perhaps a friend or two of mine. That being said, <strong>I don't delude myself into thinking anyone visits this site apart from myself</strong>, it's a good portfolio piece at the very least.</p>
